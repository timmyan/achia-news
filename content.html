<p><strong>The chia pool protocol latest update is out <a href="#">watch the video now</a>.</strong><p> 
<p>There are several key notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>When can I join pool? When pool protocol is supported by mainnet.</li>
<li>When is the pool is on mainnet? Will be 3 days after the test on testnet is done.</li>
<li>When test on testnet is done? Until all bugs are cleared and there is no estimate at the moment.</li>
<li>When can I replot to be use with pool protocol? You can do it now but there is major risk that you can't use the plots when the official mainnet version is out. I strongly recommend to wait unti then.</li>
<li>In the meantime, please check out our Github to know how to monitor your farm using dashboard or join our Discord channel where you can find help.</li>
</ul>
